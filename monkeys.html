                     <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                     <P>Monkey is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. 
                        The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys. 
                        Many monkey species are tree-dwelling, although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. 
                        Most species are mainly active during the day. Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the 
                        Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.</P> 
                     <p>Apes emerged within "monkeys" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. 
                        There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so "Old World monkey" may be taken to mean 
                        the Cercopithecoidea or the Catarrhini. That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.</p> 
                     <p>Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis,
                        and a lack of sensory whiskers.</p>
                     <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                     <p>You will find the monkeys in the rainforest.</p>
